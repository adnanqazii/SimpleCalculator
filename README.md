# SimpleCalculator
I first created the UI using buttons and TextView widgets in layout xml file. Then I created the activity corresponding to ui xml file for putting the functionality of calculator like adding,multiplying,subtracting,dividing,modulus. I handled the cases of incomplete input or division by 0. Then I made the activity launchable in manifest file
. After given instruction, I added table layout and MVC architecture(Model represented by Expression class). 'demo.mp4' is my demo video.
